\section*{Abstract}
\label{abstract}
This document describes the infrastructure required by the \ddmore Model Repository. It reviews the high-level architecture of the Repository in relation to the wider context of the project, outlining along the way design recommendations, flow of control, wire-frame mock-ups as well as potential software dependencies of the Repository. A reference implementation of the Repository will be provided to the consortium in Month 36 of the \mbox{project -- February 2014}. 

The intended audience for this technical specification are the EFPIA and academic partners that are interested in the development of an instance of the Repository, as well as stakeholders that wish to interact with the Repository in an optimal manner.
