	abstract ={Motivation: Molecular biotechnology now makes it possible to build elaborate systems models, but the systems biology community needs information standards if models are to be shared, evaluated and developed cooperatively.Results: We summarize the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Level 1, a free, open, XML-based format for representing biochemical reaction networks.  SBML is a software-independent language for describing models common to research in many areas of computational biology, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, gene regulation, and others.Availability: The specification of SBML Level 1 is freely available from http://www.sbml.org/Contact: sysbio-team@caltech.edu},

	abstract ={CellML is an XML-based exchange format developed by the University of Auckland in collaboration with Physiome Sciences, Inc. CellML 1.1 has a component-based architecture allowing a modeller to build complex systems of models that expand and reuse previously published models. CellML Metadata is a format for encoding contextual information for a model. CellML 1.1 can be used in conjunction with CellML Metadata to provide a complete description of the structure and underlying mathematics of biological models. A repository of over 200 electrophysiological,                mechanical, signal transduction, and metabolic pathway models is available at www.cellml.org.},
