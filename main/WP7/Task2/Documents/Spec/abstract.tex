\section*{Abstract}
\label{abstract}
This document describes the infrastructure required by the \ddmore Model Repository. It reviews the high-level architecture of the Repository in relation to the wider context of the project, outlining along the way design recommendations, flow of control, wire-frame mock-ups as well as potential software dependencies of the Repository.

The intended audience for this technical specification are the EFPIA and academic partners that are interested in the implementation of an instance of the Repository, as well as stakeholders that wish to interact, at a software level, with the Repository in an optimal manner.
