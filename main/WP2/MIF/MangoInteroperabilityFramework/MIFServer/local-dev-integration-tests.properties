# MIF is able to run things 'AsUser' that means that MIFServer (tomcat) can run as different user (service account) and mif client can publish
# a request as different user, all the files operations (including issuing a job to a grid) are then performed by MIF Server but as the user which
# sent the execution request to MIF
# the parameters below are used by the AsUser code
